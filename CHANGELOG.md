# Changelog

All notable changes to `@brainworker/tackback` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
(pre-1.0: the public **JavaScript** API may still change before 1.0).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-16
Initial public-prep release (staging). Standalone extraction of the Tackback library.

### Features
- **Anchored comments** on any rendered web content: **block** (whole element), **range** (text
  phrase via a W3C TextQuoteSelector), and **region** (a normalized rectangle over images, diagrams,
  inline SVG, or any non-text DOM content) — one consistent anchor model.
- **Region interaction**: right-drag to create (dashed preview → solid on save); move by dragging the
  anchor icon; resize via a hover-revealed top-left handle; non-intrusive overlays that never shift the
  host layout; an append-only move/resize history; right-click an anchor to delete it.
- **Document-region content-anchoring**: a region on the document is anchored to the content under its
  origin, so changes elsewhere on the page (e.g. an embedded PDF re-rendering at a different zoom) never
  move it.
- **Surface-bound regions are visually distinguished**: a region bound to a sub-surface (image / figure /
  `<canvas>` / PDF page — content with its own coordinate space) shows a double-frame border, vs a single
  line for a free document region.
- **Headless zero-dependency core** (state, anchors, events, import/export) + an optional **panel** UI
  (theming / reactions / i18n, EN+JA) + an optional **pdf** adapter (bring-your-own pdf.js).
- **Self-describing export**: a single JSON envelope (`schemaVersion`, document source + revision hash,
  reactions legend, comments, raster `surfaces[]` descriptors) — no backend, no network, fully offline.
- Distribution: npm subpath exports (`.`, `/panel`, `/pdf`) + a single UMD min file usable from one
  offline page with no build step; tree-shakeable ESM. A self-contained single demo (`demo/demo.html`).

### Notes
- Pre-1.0 staging: the API is functional and tested but may change before 1.0.
- **PDF / raster surfaces are post-v1**: v1 region surfaces are DOM-rendered content (images, figures,
  SVG, diagrams). The `pdf` adapter ships as an optional sample, not a v1 focus.
- Reply threads, connected-transport / AI-in-the-loop, and multi-author import/replay are present in
  the codebase but are post-v1 (the Interplay track) and not part of the v1 product surface.

  including commercial, except to provide a product that competes with Tackback.
